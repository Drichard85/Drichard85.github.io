  <h1>Freedom</h1>
  <hr>
  <h4>Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.</h4>
  <p>-- Janis Joplin</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>The chains that keep us from freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of the past, fears and anxiety about the future, ambition of the future, clinging to present things, delusions about our own importance.</h4>
  <p>--Anthony DeMello</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Freedom is being able to make choices because you <strong>want</strong> to and not because you <strong>have</strong> to.</p>
    <p>-- Dionne Richard</p>
